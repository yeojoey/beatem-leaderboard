# leaderboard-js
A simple express-based app for storing and retrieving entries in a leaderboard.

## Prerequisites
Requires [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (Available through Homebrew: `brew install mongodb`).

## Usage
Make sure that you have a [MongoDB daemon](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongod/) running, which can be started with `mongod`.

```sh
# optionally set environment variables PORT and MONGODB_PATH eg.
# export PORT=3000
npm start
```
#### Supported environment variables
`PORT`: The port that the server will listen to.
Defaults to `3000`

`MONGODB_PATH`: The path to the mongodb daemon that the server will attempt to connect to.
Defaults to `mongodb://localhost:27017/leaderboard`.

### `GET : /`
Sending a `GET` request to the root will retrieve all entries from the database, sort them by score in descending order, and serve an HTML page displaying the *rank*, *name* and *score* of each entry.

The page is declared as a [Pug](https://pugjs.org/) template at `/views/index.pug` and includes [Jquery](https://jquery.com/), [Tether](http://tether.io/) and [Bootstrap 4](https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/). For styling it includes a CSS file which is built from the [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) file at `sass/main.scss` using [node-sass-middleware](https://github.com/sass/node-sass-middleware).

### `GET : /scores`
Retrieves all entries from the database and returns them as an array in the order that MongoDB returned them.

### `POST : /scores`
Expects a body containing an object with the following properties:

```js
{
  "name": string (defaults to "Anonymous"),
  "score": number (required),
  "timestamp": date (defaults to the time at which the request was processed.)
}
```
If the object was successfully stored it returns the MongoDB `_id` of the newly stored document.
